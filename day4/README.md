# Day 4: AI chatbot 

# Date: May 31, 2023

## Main goal 
I want to create a chatbot which allows for users to input text and recieve a response based on training data processing. This will help me experiment more with python syntax but also get experience with some simple AI implications

## Future Work
1. Wider range of training data for more accurate responses
2. Use APIs to give user actual updated information rather than hardcoded answers. For example building off of day3, the user can ask what is the weather like in {city} and it can return the information.

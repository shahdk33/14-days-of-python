# Day 3: Weather application

# Date: May 29, 2023

## Main goal 
Experiment with APIs to fetch weather and other metrics. My idea is to expand this for a wild-fire update type application because of the current situation in Nova Scotia. Residents are afraid and unsure of where to find updates. The important information is scattered around twitter, government websites, and other places online. I am thinking of a place to have all information plus notifications for users to ease their anxiety and have all the information.

# Day 2: Snake Game

# Date: May 26, 2023

## Main goal 
experiment with python GUI and get familiar with python basics by making a simple  game

## Areas of Improvement for future work 

1. high score system
2. button to restart or play again after game over
3. better UI rather than just squares and circles
